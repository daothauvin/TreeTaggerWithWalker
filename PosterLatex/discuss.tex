For our Tagger with Walker's dictionary tagset :\\[2mm]
- Size of the tagset : \textbf{19 tags}. As reference, the Brown Corpus tagset has \textbf{86 tags}. Therefore, our \textbf{small number of tags} probably impacts the result.\\

- \textbf{Lost} of many useful tags from Walker's Dictionary. 
We could fix that by \textbf{tagging manually} the training set to keep most of the tags.\\

- Training on a \textbf{bigger training} set could give a better result. Most of the tags not used are rare tags that don't often appear in the training set. For example, the tag sp (for second person) appears only five times.\\[2mm]

Finally, without taking account of those remarks, it seems that \textbf{Walker's dictionary tagset can't be applied to TreeTagger} with the same accuracy as it has with modern parameter files.
