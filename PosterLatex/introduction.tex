As it is very well known, Treetagger (\textit{Helmut Schmid}, 1996) is a tool that is widely used in the Natural Language Processing domain to annotate multilingual corpora with POS taggers and lemma information. The purpose of this study is to find out whether Treetagger could learn the grammatical categories of John Walker's \textit{Critical Pronouncing Dictionary }(1791). We used the Brown Corpus, a text collection which contains 500 samples of tagged English-language text.
