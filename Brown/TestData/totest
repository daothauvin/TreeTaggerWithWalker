	Dear
Sirs

:

Let

me

begin

by

clearing

up

any

possible

misconception

in

your

minds

,

wherever

you

are

.

collective

by

which

I

address

you

in

the

title

above

is

neither

patronizing

nor

jocose

but

an

exact

industrial

term

in

use

among

professional

thieves

.

is

,

I

am

reliably

given

to

understand

,

the

technical

argot

for

those

who

engage

in

your

particular

branch

of

the

boost

;

;

,

burglars

who

rob

while

the

tenants

are

absent

,

in

contrast

to

hot-slough

prowlers

,

those

who

work

while

the

occupants

are

home

.

the

latter

obviously

require

an

audacity

you

do

not

possess

,

you

may

perhaps

suppose

that

I

am

taunting

you

as

socially

inferior

.

from

it

;

;

merely

draw

an

etymological

distinction

,

hoping

that

specialists

and

busy

people

like

you

will

welcome

such

precision

in

a

layman

.

all

,

disabuse

yourselves

of

any

thought

that

I

propose

to

vent

moral

indignation

at

your

rifling

my

residence

,

to

whimper

over

the

loss

of

a

few

objets

d'art

,

or

to

shame

you

into

rectitude

.

object

,

rather

,

is

to

alert

you

to

an

aspect

or

two

of

the

affair

that

could

have

the

gravest

implications

for

you

,

far

beyond

the

legal

sanctions

society

might

inflict

.

have

unwittingly

set

in

motion

forces

so

malign

,

so

vindictive

,

that

it

would

be

downright

inhumane

of

me

not

to

warn

you

about

them

.

candidly

,

fellows

,

I

wouldn't

be

in

your

shoes

for

all

the

rice

in

China

.

you've

doubtless

forgotten

the

circumstances

in

the

press

of

more

recent

depredations

,

permit

me

to

recapitulate

them

briefly

.

on

Saturday

evening

,

August

22nd

,

while

my

family

and

I

were

dining

at

the

Hostaria

dell'

Orso

,

in

Rome

,

you

jimmied

a

window

of

our

home

in

Bucks

County

,

Pennsylvania

,

and

let

yourselves

into

the

premises

.

to

the

attic

,

the

temperature

of

which

was

easily

hotter

than

the

Gold

Coast

,

you

proceeded

to

mask

the

windows

with

a

fancy

wool

coverlet

,

some

khaki

pants

,

and

the

like

,

and

to

ransack

the

innumerable

boxes

and

barrels

stored

there

.

you

were

looking

for

(

unless

you

make

a

hobby

of

collecting

old

tennis

rackets

and

fly

screens

)

eludes

me

,

but

to

judge

from

phonograph

records

scattered

about

a

fumed-oak

Victrola

.

danced

two

tangos

and

a

paso

doble

,

which

must

have

been

fairly

enervating

in

that

milieu

.

then

descended

one

story

,

glommed

a

television

set

from

the

music

room

--

the

only

constructive

feature

of

your

visit

,

by

the

way

--

and

,

returning

to

the

ground

floor

,

entered

the

master

bedroom

.

the

curio

cabinet

on

its

south

wall

and

the

bureaus

beneath

,

you

abstracted

seventeen

ivory

,

metal

,

wood

,

and

stone

sculptures

of

Oriental

and

African

origin

,

two

snuffboxes

,

and

a

jade-handled

magnifying

glass

.

through

a

stack

of

drawers

nearby

,

you

unearthed

an

antique

French

chess

set

in

ivory

and

sandalwood

,

which

,

along

with

two

box

Kodaks

,

you

added

to

your

haul

.

,

having

wrapped

the

lot

in

an

afghan

my

dog

customarily

slept

on

,

you

lammed

out

the

front

door

,

considerately

leaving

it

open

for

neighbors

to

discover

.

much

for

the

tiresome

facts

,

as

familiar

to

you

,

I'm

sure

,

as

to

the

constables

and

state

troopers

who

followed

in

your

wake

.

foregoing

,

aided

by

several

clues

I'll

withhold

to

keep

you

on

your

toes

,

will

pursue

you

with

a

tenacity

worthy

of

Inspector

Javert

,

but

before

they

close

in

,

gird

yourselves

,

I

repeat

,

for

a

vengeance

infinitely

more

pitiless

.

of

the

sculptures

you

took

possess

properties

of

a

most

curious

and

terrifying

nature

,

as

you

will

observe

when

your

limbs

begin

to

wither

and

your

hair

falls

out

in

patches

.

time

,

these

minor

manifestations

will

multiply

and

effloresce

,

riddling

you

with

frambesia

,

the

king's

evil

,

sheep

rot

,

and

clonic

spasm

,

until

your

very

existence

becomes

a

burden

and

you

cry

out

for

release

.

this

,

though

,

is

simply

a

prelude

,

a

curtain-raiser

,

for

what

ensues

,

and

I

doubt

whether

any

Occidental

could

accurately

forecast

it

.

,

however

,

it

would

help

to

intensify

your

anguish

,

I

can

delimit

the

powers

of

a

few

of

the

divinities

you've

affronted

and

describe

the

punishment

they

meted

out

in

one

analogous

instance

.

on

tight

of

all

,

the

six

figures

of

the

Buddha

heisted

four

Siamese

heads

,

black

obsidian

statuette

in

the

earth-touching

position

,

and

a

large

brass

figure

of

the

Dying

Buddha

on

a

teakwood

base

.

,

you

probably

share

the

widespread

Western

belief

that

the

Lord

Buddha

is

the

most

compassionate

of

the

gods

,

much

more

so

than

Jehovah

and

Allah

rest

befell

another

with

couple

of

occupied

a

Village

whose

outer

staircase

contained

the

type

of

called

had

picked

up

in

occasionally

my

wife

and

I

garlanded

it

with

flowers

or

laid

a

few

pennies

in

lap

while

,

we

became

aware

that

the

money

was

disappearing

as

fast

as

we

replenished

centered

by

the

process

up

exasperate

us

would

to

discovered

she

was

next

time

we

saw

him

was

a

person

;

;

had

aged

thirty

years

,

and

his

face

color

of

with

wrinkles

us

either

an

ape

Abe

a

process-server

we

couldn't
